THE file BTP.py is the code that gave us the results. The test_scaled, train_scaled, and valid_scaled are the three files on which the code is tested, trained, and validated, respectively. The Defects4J and Bugs.Jar datasets have been combined, and then standard scaling has been applied, followed by a three-way split, with 70% of the data for training, 15% for validation, and the remaining 15% for testing.
